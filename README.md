## 🧾 My story

I live in the northern Free State🏰, where I was born and raised👶🏽. In my younger years I found myself fond of **app creation**🈸 when I held my first smartphone📱🤳🏽. My fondness💌 drove me to discover CodeSpace🚀 where dreams become a reality🎊. Now I am learning with CodeSpace🚀, as you read I am busy burning the midnight oil🕯️going through **GitHub and version control** trying to perfect my skills🤹🏽‍♀️. In the coming days☀️ I will be going deeper into my course📖, learning how to code👨🏽‍💻, immersing🏊🏽‍♂️ myself in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** languages. One of my primary traits🤩 growing up was to try and fix everything🤖 even if it means finding a creative way to fix it out of conventional standards📐, and with that said I am looking forward to solving problems with coding👨🏽‍💻 and learning how to apply my knowledge to real-world problems.👨🏽‍🚀🚀
